            The size of butterflies varies anywhere from 0.5 inches to 11-12 inches. The largest butterflies in the
            world are normally females of a native species in New Guinea.
            A butterfly has three major parts of its body â€“ the head, thorax (chest) and the abdomen.
            Its six legs are attached to the thorax, so are the two pairs of wings. Yes, butterflies have four wings,
            not two. They can taste and smell with their feet.
            have two antennae that they use to smell, navigate and even know the time of the day.
